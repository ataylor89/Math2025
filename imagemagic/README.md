## What is algebra?

This repository contains a lot of linear algebra, so let's start with the question, "What is algebra?"

My family taught me that algebra means solving for an unknown.

Algebra is solving for an unknown.

There are many other good definitions of algebra.

Algebra is the field of mathematics concerned with solving equations and solving for unknowns.

Algebra is the art of solving equations.

You can see that there are many good definitions.

But algebra has a lot to do with two things in particular:
(1) Solving for an unknown
(2) Solving an equation

The unknown quantities are represented by variables. We give these variables names, like x, y, or z.

Arithmetic is really the field of math concerned with numbers and operations.

For example, 5 + (2 + 3)^3 is an arithmetic expression.

The arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, and roots. We can also say that negation is an operation, but it's really a form of multiplication. (Since subtraction is a form of addition, and division is a form of multiplication, it makes sense to mention negation too. Negation is a unary operation whereas the other operations are binary operations.)

We start with the field of arithmetic, the study of numbers and operations.

When we introduce a variable, we arrive at the field of algebra.

5 + (2 + 3)^3 is an arithmetic expression.

5x + (2 + 3)^3 = 200 is an algebraic equation.

We can solve this equation for x, using the rules of algebra, also known as the laws of algebra.

We can simplify the expression 5 + (2 + 3)^3 using the rules of arithmetic.

We can simplify the expression ((x + 1/2) + isqrt(3)/2)((x + 1/2) - isqrt(3)/2) using the rules of complex arithmetic.

We can simplify the expression sqrt(-3) * sqrt(-3) using the rules of complex arithmetic.

We can solve the equation 5x + (2 + 3)^3 = 200 using the rules of algebra.

You might ask, are there rules of calculus? are there laws of calculus? The answer is yes, there are.

There are rules for differentiation, rules for integration. There is also l'Hopital's rule.

There is an algorithm for taking the definite integral of a function f(x) from a to b.

The definite integral of f(x) from a to b is F(b) - F(a), where F is any antiderivative of f(x), provided that f(x) is a continuous on [a, b]. (One condition for this theorem is that f(x) is continuous on [a, b]).

This theorem is called the fundamental theorem of calculus.

I'll repeat that, because it's important.

The fundamental theorem of calculus states that the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is F(b) - F(a), where F is any antiderivative of f, provided that f(x) is continuous on [a, b].

We can actually use our knowledge of differential calculus in order to use and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.

For example, suppose we want to integrate cos(x) on the interval [0, π/2]. We know that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so we can use sin(x) as our antiderivative.

Thus Integral_0^{π/2} cos(x) dx = sin(π/2) - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.

We just used our knowledge of differential calculus, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, to calculate the definite integral of cos(x) on the interval [0, π/2].

(When taking the definite integral of f(x) on [a, b], we can integrate f(x) directly if we know the rules for integrating f(x), but if we don't, we can work our way backwards, and find a function F(x) whose derivative is f(x), using trial and error, using the rules of differentation. In general, differentiation is easier than integration. We can use the definition of a derivative to calculate a derivative. We can use the concept of an antiderivative to integrate a function, since the definite integral is related to the antiderivative. The definition of a derivative is easier to work with than the Riemann sum definition of an integral... which is why the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is so useful, since it allows us to use an antiderivative and apply our knowledge of derivatives.)

So listen...

We went off on a tangent.

We covered the rules of arithmetic (it's important to know the arithmetic operations -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, roots, negation -- and also the order of operations... PEMDAS).

We covered the rules of complex arithmetic (we need these rules in order to calculate sqrt(-3) * sqrt(-3)).

We covered the rules of algebra (we need these rules in order to solve equations).

We covered the rules of calculus (differentiation, integration, the fundamental theorem of calculus, l'Hopital's rule).

It's worth mentioning the fundamental theorem of algebra... since we mentioned the fundamental theorem of calculus.

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, and a polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n complex solutions, provided that n is a positive integer.

It's also important to know the rules of modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic has many uses in encryption. For example, we use modular arithmetic whenever we write a rotation cipher, like rot13 or rot88.

Okay. Let's go back to the original question.

What is algebra?

Algebra is solving for an unknown.

There are many other branches of mathematics (like arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra, combinatorics, probability, number theory, et cetera).

Arithmetic is the study of numbers and operations.

Calculus is calculating a slope or an area.

Trigonometry is the study of triangles.

Combinatorics is the field of math concerned with counting.

I actually learned these definitions from my family.

My family taught me these definitions, and I thought I would share them.

Now, what is the definition of linear algebra?

We use so much linear algebra in this repository. What is the definition of linear algebra?

We will now proceed to answer this question, since we have enough background to begin studying this subject.

We will proceed to answer the questions:
1) What is the definition of linear algebra?
2) Do we really need linear algebra, and why do we have it in the first place?
3) What are some applications of linear algebra?
4) How do we use linear algebra in this repository?
