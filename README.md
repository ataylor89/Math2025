## LaTeX
In order to generate the LaTeX PDFs (e.g. recurrence-formula.pdf and sumoffirstnsquares.pdf), I used the Art of Problem Solving Texer application. It can be found here: https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer/.

I highly recommend the AoPS Texer software. It is one of the most convenient ways of writing LaTeX.

I copied the LaTeX source code for the PDFs into .tex files.

If you are interesting in learning the LaTeX mathematical markup language, you can read a tutorial on the AoPS Wiki: https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX.

LaTeX is my go-to markup language for writing mathematical documents. I have been using it since high school. I used to compose it in GUIs, but ever since I discovered the AoPS Texer application, I have not gone back.
