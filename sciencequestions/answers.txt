1. Why does it rain?

Water evaporates from land and water, and rises through the air, as water vapor, until it reaches the level of clouds. Once it reaches the level of clouds, the water vapor condenses on particles of dust that are in the clouds.

Once the water vapor condenses on particles of dust, it forms water droplets that are suspended in the air.

There are two forces acting on these water droplets:
(1) The force of gravity which pulls them toward the earth
(2) The force of friction which suspends them in the air

The friction force I am talking about is also called air resistance.

On a cold day, the air is denser, which means the friction force that suspends water droplets can be greater, because there are more air molecules huddled beneath every water droplet.

We see that temperature is a factor that affects the chance of rain.

If it is too hot, then water remains in the form of water vapor, and does not condense in the clouds as much.

If it is too cold, then the air beneath the water droplets or ice particles is so dense that the chances of rain are very slim, because of the magnitude of air resistance that suspends these water droplets or ice particles.

So there is actually a specific temperature range where the chance of rain is highest.

Now let's answer our question. Why does it rain?

It rains when the force of gravity acting on water droplets exceeds the force of friction that suspends them.
