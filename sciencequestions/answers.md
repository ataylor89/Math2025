## 1. Why does it rain?

Water evaporates from land and water, and rises through the air, as water vapor, until it reaches the level of clouds. Once it reaches the level of clouds, the water vapor condenses on particles of dust that are in the clouds.

Once the water vapor condenses on particles of dust, it forms water droplets that are suspended in the air.

There are two forces acting on these water droplets:
1. The force of gravity which pulls them toward the earth
2. The force of friction which suspends them in the air

The friction force I am talking about is also called air resistance.

On a cold day, the air is denser, which means the friction force that suspends water droplets can be greater, because there are more air molecules huddled beneath every water droplet.

We see that temperature is a factor that affects the chance of rain.

If it is too hot, then water remains in the form of water vapor, and does not condense in the clouds as much.

If it is too cold, then the air beneath the water droplets or ice particles is so dense that the chances of rain are very slim, because of the magnitude of air resistance that suspends these water droplets or ice particles.

So there is actually a specific temperature range where the chance of rain is highest.

Now let's answer our question. Why does it rain?

It rains when the force of gravity acting on water droplets exceeds the force of friction that suspends them.

## 2. Why is the sky blue?

The sky is blue because the molecules in the air scatter blue light more than they scatter red light, and the blue light gets reflected back to the observer. This is a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.

To use a different terminology, the resonant frequencies of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are in the blue portion of the visible spectrum. They scatter blue light in all directions, more than they scatter other frequencies.

## 3. Why is a sunset red?

During sunrise or sunset, light from the sun travels through a longer path of the atmosphere before it reaches our eyes. It also travels through a lower altitude, where the air is denser and more crowded.

Blue light gets scattered so much, on this longer path through the atmosphere, that it hardly reaches us.

What reaches us instead, are the longer wavelengths of visible light, namely, red and orange, because they are scattered much less than the other colors of light, and they are far more concentrated.

Rayleigh scattering, and the resonant frequencies of nitrogen and oxygen, explain why the sky is blue, and they also explain why the sunset is red, because the same principles are at work.
