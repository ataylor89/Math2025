# Foreword

To begin this project I would like to start with a couple of quotes:

1. "You must ask yourself the big questions. Who are you and what do you want?" (Uncle Iroh from Avatar)
2. "Who am I? What am I doing? Why am I here?" (Levin from Anna Karenina)

My family made a riff on the quote from Uncle Iroh. Here is our riff:

> "You must ask yourself the important questions. Why does it rain? Why is a sunset red? Why is the sky blue?"

Inspired by this riff, inspired by Avatar, inspired by Tolstoy, we are going to proceed with answering some of the most important questions, like, "Why does it rain?" and "Why is the sky blue?" and "Why is a sunset red?"

The answers are provided in this folder. I will create a questions.md file and an answers.md file.
