## What is a cipher?

My family taught me the meaning of the word "cipher".

The word "cipher" has at least two meanings.

A cipher can be an encrypted message (like the encrypted message contained in cipher.txt).

A cipher can also be an encryption algorithm (like the rot13 substitution cipher).

The word "cipher" can be a noun (e.g. ciphertext, rot13 substitution cipher).

The word "cipher" can also be a verb (e.g. cipher a message, decipher a code).

The words "message" and "cipher" are used often in the field of encryption. The word "cipher" can refer to the output of an encryption algorithm... it can also refer to the encryption algorithm itself.
